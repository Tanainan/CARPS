## Article ID: EXT_5-2-2016

For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section for Study 1.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Descriptive statistics for punishment, allocations,and valuation. Behavior in our modified third-partypunishment game resembled behavior in typical versions.As usual, punishers were sometimes willing topunish (Fig. 1). For instance, when assuming that dictatorsallocated nothing to recipients, 55% of punishers (65of 119) spent at least $1 on punishment, and 15% (18 of119) spent their entire $5 on punishment. Dictators weresometimes willing to allocate money to recipients (diamondsin Fig. 1). For instance, 64% of dictators (76 of 119) were willing to allocate at least some money to recipients, and 38% (45 of 119) were willing to allocate atleast half of the total stake. Even when dictators allocatedhalf or more of their stake to recipients, a minority ofpunishers were still willing to punish. This might reflectnoise, as subjects who did not anticipate such decisionsbeing actualized may have answered with less concern,or it might reflect antisocial punishment, which has beenobserved in other games (Herrmann, Thöni, & Gächter,2008; Masclet, Noussair, Tucker, & Villeval, 2003). Whendictators allocated all $10, punishment, though still costly,was completely ineffective; in this case, dictators had noresidual endowment that punishment could reduce.Nonetheless, past experiments have also shown that peopleare willing to pay for costly punishment even whensuch punishment is completely ineffective (Yamagishiet al., 2009).Dictators moderately valued recipients and punishers(Ms = .22 and .23, respectively). Roughly, a dictator wouldforgo receiving up to $4 if recipients and punishers couldreceive $20.

> Punishers assume that dictators’ treatment ofrecipients predicts how much dictators value punishers.As we have shown, dictators’ divisions towardrecipients predict how much dictators value punishers.But do third parties actually make inferences using thiscue? This is a primary prediction of the deterrencehypothesis, and our results confirmed it: As shown inFigure 2a, the more that dictators allocated to recipients,the more they were thought to value both the punisherand the recipient. In fact, the inferences punishers made for the two targets (themselves and recipients) wereindistinguishable. Using a 2 × 2 repeated measuresANOVA with allocation and target as factors, we foundthat the effect of allocation on inferences was significant,F(2.32, 273.72) = 18.15, p < .001, η2 = .13, but there wasno effect of target and no interaction between target andallocation (ps = .25 and .17; see Table S2 in the SupplementalMaterial).
